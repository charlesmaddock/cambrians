# Cambrians
Cambrians is an AI-ecosystem simulator that uses Numpy for creating simple neural networks with matrix multiplication and Pygame to render the agents.

# How to run Cambrians
1. Download all the files or clone the project.
2. Navigate to the folder called "Python" with the commandline.
3. Run python3 Main.py. It should start.
4. Use the arrow keys to move around, press organisms to view their stats. Find all the other keybinds in Main.py.

# Thesis paper
This project was made in for my high school thesis paper ("gymnasiearbete" in Swedish). The project's goal was to study how and if it is possible to create digital ecosystems with the help of AI agents that evolve through natural selection.

# Awards
Cambrians managed to win a scholarship trip to Macao in the Swedish youth science competition 'Utställningen Unga Forskare'. On that scholarship trip the project won gold and the 'Presidents Award' in CASTIC, Asia's largest youth science competition.
